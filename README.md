# Lung-and-Colon-Cancer-Detection-Using-Custom-CNN
Abstract: Lungs and Colon cancer have been two of the most significant  causes of cancer related deaths, worldwide. So, detecting and accurately diagnosing cancer is of paramount importance.  CNNs have been giving promising results in various classification, identification and image processing tasks since their inception. Due to this, CNNs have been prominently used in the healthcare sector for medical image analysis, image segmentation, etc. Using these automated systems has helped medical personnel not only to correctly detect a disease but has also made the  diagnosis process swift and economical. However, bettering the accuracy of the diagnosis is challenging. In this study, we proposed a CNN architecture to classify the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images. The model is trained and tested for 3 different modes of configurations(Lung tissue Classification, Colon Tissue Classification and Lung+Colon Tissue Classification). To compare the performance of our model, we used the pre-trained EfficientNet B0 on the same dataset with the same 3 configurations. Our model,with 595K parameters, is able to get accuracy exceeding 99\% on all the three configurations and its performance is at par with the EfficientNet B0, which has more than 5 million parameters.
